# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Reviews-using-BERT

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis stands as a prevalent application within the realm of Natural Language Processing. Its significance has grown considerably, particularly in light of online reviews and ratings, which play a pivotal role in shaping the decisions and purchases of internet users. Businesses, recognizing the impact of these reviews, can employ sentiment analysis to discern their strengths, weaknesses, and gain valuable insights into the overall market response to their services.

## Dataset

Reviews from multiple websites like Amazon reviews are available on Kaggle by the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) and Yelp business reviews scraped from the website. Each review comment having a 1-to-5-star rating associated with it.

## BERT

BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It's a language model and machine learning framework that uses neural networks to pre-train natural language processing. 

BERT is based on Transformers, a deep learning model that connects every output element to every input element. The weightings between the elements are dynamically calculated based on their connection. BERT uses static masking, meaning the same part of a sentence is masked in each Epoch. The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the goal is to predict the original vocabulary ID of the masked word based on its context.
